# healthcare-readmission-analysis

This project analyzes hospital readmission rates using synthetic healthcare data generated by Synthea. Among the multiple data sources provided, the focus was on Encounters, Patients, and Conditions files as they provide the most relevant information for readmission analysis.
The main goal is to calculate the readmission rate, one of the key metrics for evaluating hospital performance, and explore it from different perspectives.

## Objectives

-Calculate the overall readmission rate
-Exclude same-day transfers (not true readmissions)
-Compute readmission intervals (days_to_readmit)
-Analyze readmissions by length of stay (LOS) categories
-Study yearly trends in readmission rates
-Explore the distribution of readmission times

## Data Sources 

-Encounters.csv → Hospital admissions and visits
-Patients.csv → Demographic information (age, gender, etc.)
-Conditions.csv → Medical conditions and diagnoses

## Notebooks Overview

### 01_data_exploration.ipynb

Load and explore datasets (EDA)
Identify missing values and perform basic cleaning
Analyze the distribution of hospital length of stay (LOS)
Explore readmission timing distributions
Initial readmission rate calculations

### 02_risk_factor_analysis.ipynb

Combine Patients and Conditions for deeper insights
Analyze readmission rates by demographics (age, gender, etc.)
Assess the impact of chronic conditions on readmissions
Special focus on patients with multiple admissions
Explore condition-specific readmission relationships

### 03_sql_analysis.ipynb

Create an SQLite database with patients, encounters, and conditions tables
Use SQL queries to:
-Calculate 30-day readmission rate
-Exclude same-day transfers
-Compute discharge-to-readmission intervals
Validate SQL results with Pandas and visualize outcomes
Key finding: 30-day readmission rate = 27.5%

## Key Insights

-The overall 30-day readmission rate is 27.5%.
-Patients with shorter length of stay (LOS) tend to have higher readmission rates.
-Certain chronic conditions are associated with elevated readmission risks.
-Yearly trends show fluctuations in readmission rates.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the analysis of hospital readmission rates, a critical healthcare quality metric, across different dimensions.
